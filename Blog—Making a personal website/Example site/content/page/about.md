**I'm Andrew.**  There are a lot of things I don’t know, but I’m not afraid to admit it and that means I pick things up quickly.   I get a buzz out of learning and trying to figure out tricky problems.  I'm currently studying to become a qualified actuary with [Lane Clark & Peacock](https://www.lcp.uk.com/).

Knowing that my work is having a **positive impact** is important to me.  Over the course of my career I hope to become more and more capable of developing tools and giving advice to help people make sense of complicated situations.

In my studies and wider work, I've become increasingly interested in **data, statistics and modelling**.  I write articles for this site as a way of exploring problems and methods for solving them.

I graduated from **Durham Univsersity** with a first-class honours BSc degree in Physics.  Among other things, during my time there I:
* was a course representative and co-chaired the department's [Student-Staff Consultative Committee](https://www.dur.ac.uk/physics/internal/committees/sscc/);
* worked as part of a team researching a real-world manufacturing problem with [GlaxoSmithKline](https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/); 
* provided first aid cover to university events as a volunteer with [St John Ambulance](https://www.sja.org.uk/); and
* wrote a [literature review](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uey5TDgUkeCCR61b2Ba8mA9BBVWQ_ubg/view?usp=sharing) on the future technology of hard disk drives.

I live in **London, UK**.  Outside of my work I enjoy volunteering, playing the piano, speaking French, and running.
