# python-projects

Online repository for bits and/or bobs I've been working on, notably:

- Jupyter notebooks associated with my blog posts at www.andrewhetherington.com;
- projects from my time studying Physics at Durham University; and
- my attempts at the exercises from Aurélien Géron's "Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow".
